    <h1>Dear Sofii,</h1>
    <p>
        As my internship comes to an end, I wanted to let you know how much I’ve appreciated working with you on the BIO-FDR project. I’m really sorry that I have to say goodbye and leave you to continue the project on your own.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope you’ll find support from Yasmin, Nabila, or maybe even a new friend to help you out. Your talent and dedication are truly inspiring, and I have no doubt you’ll keep things moving forward brilliantly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for being such a fantastic partner and for all the great times we had working together. I wish you all the best in finishing up the project and in everything you do in the future.
    </p>
