    <h1>Goodbye, Chef Lord memasak Akhtar!</h1>
    <p>
        It's hard to believe that my internship is coming to an end. Working with you has been an incredible experience, and I can't thank you enough for your kindness and support throughout our time together.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve always admired your passion for cybersecurity, especially your enthusiasm for CTF challenges. 
    <p>
        I’ll also miss lunchtime at PB. Those moments were some of the best, and I’m grateful for every one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although our paths may diverge for now, I’m sure we’ll cross them again in the future. Until then, keep hacking, keep learning, and stay awesome!
    </p>

        Wishing you all the best, <br>
